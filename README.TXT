The Curecoin Client is a simple TCP program to enable users to interact with the Curecoin daemon.

None of the code is special in any way, and comments are minimal. 

If not for the one-line length limitations of netcat, netcat could be a stand-in replacement for this client. If doing anything other than submitting a certificate or transaction manually, netcat works fine.

In the future, this program will have much more special Curecoin sauce--authentication, formatting, possibly the ability to set up limited-access RPC proxies.
